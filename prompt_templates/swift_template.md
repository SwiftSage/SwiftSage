### Example Task 1
 
<task>
Convert the point $(0, -3 \sqrt{3}, 3)$ in rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(\rho,\theta,\phi),$ where $\rho > 0,$ $0 \le \theta < 2 \pi,$ and $0 \le \phi \le \pi.$
</task>

<plan>
Step 1. Recall the formulas for converting from rectangular coordinates $(x, y, z)$ to spherical coordinates $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$:
   - $\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$
   - $\theta = \arctan2(y, x)$
   - $\phi = \arccos\left(\frac{z}{\rho}\right)$

Step 2. Given point: $(0, -3\sqrt{3}, 3)$
   $x = 0$
   $y = -3\sqrt{3}$
   $z = 3$

Step 3. Calculate $\rho$ using the formula.

Step 4. Calculate $\theta$:
   - Since $x = 0$, we need to handle this special case.
   - When $x = 0$ and $y < 0$, $\theta = \frac{3\pi}{2}$

Step 5. Calculate $\phi$ using the formula.

Step 6. Ensure $\theta$ is in the range $[0, 2\pi)$ and $\phi$ is in the range $[0, \pi]$.

<code> 
from sympy import sqrt, atan2, acos, pi

def rectangular_to_spherical():
    x, y, z = 0, -3*sqrt(3), 3
    rho = sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)
    theta = atan2(y, x)
    phi = acos(z/rho)
    return rho, theta, phi

spherical_coordinates = rectangular_to_spherical()

### Example Task 2 

<task>
Determine who lived longer between Lowell Sherman and Jonathan Kaplan.
</task>

<plan>
Step 1: Research the birth and death dates of Lowell Sherman.
Step 2: Research the birth and death dates of Jonathan Kaplan.
Step 3: Calculate the lifespan of each person in years.
Step 4: Compare the lifespans to determine who lived longer.
</plan>

<code>
from datetime import datetime

def calculate_lifespan(birth_date, death_date):
    birth = datetime.strptime(birth_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
    death = datetime.strptime(death_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
    return (death - birth).days / 365.25

def compare_lifespans():
    lowell_sherman = calculate_lifespan("1885-10-11", "1934-12-28")
    jonathan_kaplan = calculate_lifespan("1947-11-25", "2021-01-03")
    
    if lowell_sherman > jonathan_kaplan:
        return "Lowell Sherman"
    elif jonathan_kaplan > lowell_sherman:
        return "Jonathan Kaplan"
    else:
        return "They lived equally long"

result = compare_lifespans()
print(f"{result} lived longer.")
</code>

<final_answer>
Jonathan Kaplan lived longer.
