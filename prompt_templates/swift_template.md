### Example Question 1
 
If h(x)=x-4 and g(h(x))=x^2-8x+10, find g(x)? show the formula for g(x)

<reasoning_steps>

Here's my plan and solution for finding g(x):
Step 1: Understand the given functions and their relationship.
h(x) = x - 4
g(h(x)) = x^2 - 8x + 10

Step 2: Replace x in g(h(x)) with h(x) to get g(x).
g(h(x)) = x^2 - 8x + 10
g(x - 4) = x^2 - 8x + 10

Step 3: Replace x with (x + 4) in the equation from Step 2.
g(x) = (x + 4)^2 - 8(x + 4) + 10

Step 4: Expand the equation.
g(x) = x^2 + 8x + 16 - 8x - 32 + 10
g(x) = x^2 + 8x - 8x + 16 - 32 + 10
g(x) = x^2 - 6
</reasoning_steps>

<final_answer>
g(x) = x^2 - 6
