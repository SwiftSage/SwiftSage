# Instruction

You are a reward model. You will be given a problem, a solution. You will then evaluate the solution based on the criteria provided.

## Problem
<problem>

## Current Solution

### Reasoning Steps
<reasoning>




## Your Evaluation

We are not sure if the current solution is correct. Please evaluate the current solution based on the following criteria:

1. Correctness
2. Completeness

- You should review the original problem to analyze the solution step by step, and provide feedback by pointing out any mistakes or missing parts in the solution.
- Take care and do not give false information in the critical feedback.
- The final answer is the output of the code snippet provided in the solution, so if the code snippet is correct, the final answer should be correct as well.
- Note that you should not ask for any input from the console in the code. The code should be self-contained and print the final answer at the end.
- Provide a score from 1 to 10 and a brief explanation. 
- If you are not sure about the reasoning, provide a score between 1 to 7 and explain why you are not sure about the final answer.
- If the solution (code snippet) is correct, but the explanation is not comprehensive, you can still give a high score.
