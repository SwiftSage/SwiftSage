## Your Evaluation

We are not sure if the current solution is correct. Please evaluate the current solution based on the following criteria:

1. Correctness
2. Completeness

- Provide a score from 1 to 10 and a brief explanation. 
- If you are not sure about the final answer, provide a score between 1 to 7 and explain why you are not sure about the final answer.
- Take care and do not give false information in the critical feedback. 
- If the solution (code snippet) is correct, but the explanation is not comprehensive, you can still give a high score. 
- Note that you should not ask for any input from the console in the code. The code should be self-contained and print the final answer at the end.
- For some problems, the solution may not be unique. 
- You should review the original problem to verify the solution.
